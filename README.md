## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction using a heterogeneous graph. The approach involves training a GNN model on the MovieLens dataset, utilizing the Captum Explainer technique to provide insights into individual link predictions, and employing a surrogate model for validation. The results demonstrate improved interpretability and trust in the GNN's predictions, contributing to the field of explainable GNNs and facilitating better decision-making in link prediction tasks.

## Data Description
If you install the project manually, you do not need to download the dataset 
We are using MovieLens dataset consisted of movie ratings, which we represented as a heterogeneous graph. It includes diverse information, including movie ratings, user profiles, genre details, and movie metadata.

The dataset have 610 unique users and a movie features with 20 columns, encompassing genres like Action, Adventure, Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller.

The statistics of the dataset is shown below:

| Data  | Graphs  |
|-------|--------|
| Number of nodes | 10,334  |  
| Number of edges | 100,836  |   


## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for link prediction in a heterogeneous graph. 
The GNN encoder utilizes SAGEConv layers to aggregate information from neighboring nodes and learn node representations. 
The model employs a Captum Explainer technique to provide explanations for individual link predictions. 
Additionally, a surrogate model (Random Forest) is used to compare and validate the explanations provided by the Captum Explainer. 
This architecture enhances the interpretability and transparency of the GNN model.

## Explainability Techniques

In order to enhance the explainability of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for link prediction, two techniques were employed: 

### 1.Captum Explainer
The Captum Explainer technique attributed importance scores to nodes and edges, providing insights into the decision-making process of the GNN model at an individual edge level. This technique helped identify influential features and their relationships within the graph.

### 2.Using Random Forest for Explaination.
Using Random Forest was employed to validate and compare the explanations provided by the Captum Explainer. The combination of these techniques facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving the predictions of the GNN model, enhancing its interpretability and transparency.
